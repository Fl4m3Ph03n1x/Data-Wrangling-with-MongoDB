This repo contains the code for the Data Wrangling with MongoDB Course 
(by MongoDB University available at Udacity https://www.udacity.com/course/data-wrangling-with-mongodb--ud032) 
that teaches how to convert and manipulate messy data to extract what you need.
                                                       
This course focused on the following technologies:

 - Python
 - MongoDB

And in the following file formats:

 - CSV
 - XML
 - JSON

I personally found this course to be very interesting. My knowledge about MondoDB
was greatly improved (which was my main objective) and the real case studies only 
made it more challenging and interesting. 

For future generations/reference, I hereby place this code, hoping it helps someone
(perhaps that someone will be me plus a couple of years :P)
